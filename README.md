Restarting work on the component. The Home Assistant team has been too busy so the Pull Requests take time to review and I want to enable people to try new features that they request while the PRs are waiting for reviews.
Everything in the component will also be created as PRs in the main Home Assistant branch so this will be some "early access" option. Also, everything pushed on Home Assistant will be migrated here.
